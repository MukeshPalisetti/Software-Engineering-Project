Use Case is a graphical way of showing how our project works.
It consists of 4 components.
1) Entries - These are generally the functionalities represented in a oval shape.
2) Actor - One who interacts with the system i.e admin, customer..etc.
3) System Boundary - This is the boundary that seperates system from actors.
4) Relations - Relations are of 2 types i.e include, extend.
   Include - Which must be run in order to perform base use case.
   Extend - Optional use case which extends the base use case, base use case can run successfully even without invoking/calling the extending use case.
